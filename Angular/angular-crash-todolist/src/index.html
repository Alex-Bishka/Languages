  This is the main page that loads in the browser. Angular, Vue, React,
  are all single page app frameworks. Really only loads a single page in
  the browser.

  The app-root directive is embedding the root app component. All components
  we create will go inside of that.

  Single page apps (or SPA) is a type of web application where navigation
  becomes possible without refreshing the page and codes like HTML, CSS, JS,
  etc. are brought in dynamically by laoding the page only once. This provides
  a fast and responsive user experience.

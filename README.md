# Languages

This repo will include mostly youtube tutorials on new languages that I am learning. It may include a refresh on languages I haven't used in a while as well. The point of the repo is to get me to 1) start practicing the language I am learning/reviewing and 2) to have a reference in the future, in case I get rusty with that language. This may be extended to frameworks too, especially if the framework uses that language.

### TypeScript
This tutorial covered the basics of TS. It began with types, some simple and some more complex (although nothing too tricky in the end). Afterwards the tutorial covered functions and interfaces. Lastly, it wrapped up with a breif overview of classes and inheritance. Pretty solid review of OOP and basic TS for about 50 minutes. The files inside the TypeScript folder are named based on the topic discussed. Additionally, an index html file is inclued to view console log statements. The compiled JS files were also included (not sure if they had to be, but it's kinda cool to see how TS is complied into JS before it runs from the script tag in the html file).

May follow up with an Angular tutorial, especially since I need to learn that framework and it uses TS.

### Angular
Notations are within the files, mainly the index.html, app.* and newly generated components. For generation of components, using ```ng generate component path``` is quite nice and can be shortened by using ```ng g c path```. To start up the server use ```ng serve``` and the ```--open``` flag to open in browser immediately.
